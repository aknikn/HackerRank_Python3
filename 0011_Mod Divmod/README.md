# 0011: [Mod Divmod](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-mod-divmod/problem "https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-mod-divmod/problem")
- level: Easy
- language: Python3


## Description of the problem
One of the built-in functions of Python is divmod, which takes two arguments a and b and returns a tuple containing the quotient of a/b first and then the remainder a.<br>
For example:<br><br>
> >>> print divmod(177,10)<br>
> (17, 7)

Here, the integer division is 177/10 => 17 and the modulo operator is 177%10 => 7.

### Task
Read in two integers, a and b, and print three lines.<br
The first line is the integer division a//b (While using Python2 remember to import division from __future__).<br
The second line is the result of the modulo operator: a%b.<br
The third line prints the divmod of a and b.

### Input Format
The first line contains the first integer, a, and the second line contains the second integer, b.

### Output Format
Print the result as described above.

### Sample Input 0
> 177
> 10


### Sample Output 0
> 17
> 7
> (17, 7)
